## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK or later

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/StevenSSparks/AdventureRealms.git
cd AdventureRealms

# Run in development mode
dotnet run -f net9.0 --project AdventureRealms/AdventureRealms.csproj
```

#### Build and Run
```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build

# Run the built application
dotnet run --project AdventureRealms
```

## Building Release Versions

### Self-Contained Standalone Executables

Build standalone executables that include the .NET runtime and require no .NET installation on the target machine:

#### macOS (Apple Silicon - ARM64)
```bash
dotnet publish AdventureRealms/AdventureRealms.csproj -c Release -f net9.0 --self-contained true -r osx-arm64 -o ./publish/osx-arm64
```

#### macOS (Intel - x64)
```bash
dotnet publish AdventureRealms/AdventureRealms.csproj -c Release -f net9.0 --self-contained true -r osx-x64 -o ./publish/osx-x64
```

#### Windows (x64)
```bash
dotnet publish AdventureRealms/AdventureRealms.csproj -c Release -f net9.0 --self-contained true -r win-x64 -o ./publish/win-x64
```

#### Windows (ARM64)
```bash
dotnet publish AdventureRealms/AdventureRealms.csproj -c Release -f net9.0 --self-contained true -r win-arm64 -o ./publish/win-arm64
```

#### Linux (x64)
```bash
dotnet publish AdventureRealms/AdventureRealms.csproj -c Release -f net9.0 --self-contained true -r linux-x64 -o ./publish/linux-x64
```

#### Linux (ARM64)
```bash
dotnet publish AdventureRealms/AdventureRealms.csproj -c Release -f net9.0 --self-contained true -r linux-arm64 -o ./publish/linux-arm64
```

### Command Parameters Explained

- `-c Release` - Release configuration (optimized build)
- `-f net9.0` - Target framework (required for multi-target projects)
- `--self-contained true` - Includes .NET runtime in the output
- `-r <runtime>` - Target platform runtime identifier
- `-o <path>` - Output directory for the published application

### Running Published Applications

After building, run the standalone executable directly:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./publish/osx-x64/AdventureRealms

# Windows
./publish/win-x64/AdventureRealms.exe
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite to validate game mechanics:

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific game walkthrough tests
dotnet test --filter "CompleteGameWalkthroughTests"

# Run item interaction tests
dotnet test --filter "ItemInteractionTests"
```

### Key Technologies
- .NET 9.0
- Terminal.Gui (for modern text UI)
- Spectre.Console (for enhanced console output)
- xUnit (for testing)
- MemoryCache (for session management)

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Windows-Only Projects (Optional)
The repository includes optional Windows-specific packaging projects that have been moved to separate folders:
- `AdventureRealms.Package.WINDOWS_ONLY/` - Windows Application Packaging Project (.wapproj)
- `Setup.WINDOWS_ONLY/` - Windows Installer Project (.vdproj)

These are only needed if you want to create Windows Store packages or MSI installers. The main Adventure Realms application is fully cross-platform and doesn't require these projects.
