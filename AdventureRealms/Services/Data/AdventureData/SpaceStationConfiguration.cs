EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS ACTIVATED

You have awakened from hibernation aboard the space station to find it mysteriously abandoned. 
The emergency lighting casts eerie shadows through the corridors, and strange sounds echo from 
the ventilation systems.

Your survival depends on finding the ESCAPE POD, but it requires proper authorization. 
You'll need to explore the station's four levels:

* COMMAND DECK (Level 1) - Administrative and control systems
* CREW QUARTERS (Level 2) - Living spaces and personal areas
* SCIENCE LABS (Level 3) - Research facilities and experiments
* ENGINEERING (Level 4) - Power systems and the escape pod

CONTROLS:
* Move: N, S, E, W, U (up), D (down)
* Get items: GET [item] or TAKE [item]
* Use items: USE [item] or specific action verbs
* Drop items: DROP [item]
* Look: LOOK or LOOK [item]
* Inventory: I or INVENTORY
* Activate robot: ACTIVATE ROBOT
* Attack creatures: ATTACK [monster] WITH [weapon]
* Map: MAP (shows current level layout)
* Help: HELP or ?
* Quit: QUIT or EXIT

WARNING: Reports indicate hostile life forms may have emerged from contaminated experiments. 
Stay alert and arm yourself appropriately.

Emergency systems show limited time before life support fails.
Find the escape pod authorization and evacuate immediately!";

CONGRATULATIONS, SURVIVOR!

You have successfully escaped the abandoned space station before it became completely overrun 
by the mysterious creatures! Your quick thinking and resourcefulness saved your life.

As you drift safely toward the nearest rescue beacon, you reflect on the strange events that 
led to the station's abandonment. The commander's log revealed the tragic irony - an engineer 
demoted to cook, attempting to win back favor by using an antimatter accelerator to bake a 
birthday cake, accidentally creating the hostile creatures that doomed the station.

Your robot companion's assistance proved invaluable in your escape. Perhaps in the future, 
space stations will have better safety protocols... and stricter kitchen equipment regulations!

Thank you for playing 'Abandoned Space Station'!
May the stars guide you safely home.

Emergency protocols have been activated. Station status: UNKNOWN.
All crew personnel are unaccounted for. Life support systems operating on emergency power.

Strange readings detected throughout the station. Multiple system failures reported.
Hostile life forms may be present.

Recommendation: Investigate station status and locate emergency evacuation procedures immediately.

Your mission: Find the escape pod authorization and evacuate before life support fails!

Good luck, {gamerTag}. The station's fate may depend on your actions.
